# Playing-With-Words
A program written in C++ demonstrating varied features of the language - object oriented design and programming, file I/O and STL containers and algorithms to have a get go toward playing with words. The program populates a set of strings from a supplied file of dictionary words. It then reads and analyzes sample text from a separate file, classifying its words as either known (word exists in the dictionary) or unknown (word does not exist in the dictionary), keeps a track of their respective positions in the sample text and further maintains their frequencies of occurrence. The program also displays text statistics - the most frequent known and unknown words and finally reconstructs the original sample text based on the recorded positions of the known and unknown words.
